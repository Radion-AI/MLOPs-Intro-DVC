# Session 1 - MLOPs Introduction and Version control

This assignment focuses on ML introduction and version control of code and data files using [dvc](https://dvc.org/doc)

### Asssignment objectives: 
1. Training dog and cat classifier 
2. To follow [dvc tutorial](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-model-files/tutorial) for version control of data
3. To train model twice with two different datasets with having atleast 10 epochs
4. To create a metrics.csv file that contains the epoch,loss,accuracy,val_loss,val_accuracy
5. Accuracy must be above 70%
6. To create a github action flow over the project with tests
7. Do not upload data.zip (check where it is expected)
8. Do not upload model.pt file (check where it is expected)
9. Accuracy of the model is more than 70% (read from metrics)
